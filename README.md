# IoT-Predictive-Maintenance
An IoT-Based Predictive Maintenance System that leverages AWS Cloud and Python analytics to forecast equipment failures before they occur. The system collects real-time sensor data through AWS IoT Core, processes it on AWS EC2, and uses machine learning models (Pandas, Scikit-learn) for predictive analytics.
